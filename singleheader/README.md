## Amalgamation demo

While in the ada main directory, using Python 3, type:

```
python singleheader/amalgamate.py
```

This will create two new files (ada.h and ada.cpp).

You can then compile the demo file as follows:

```
c++ -std=c++17 -c demo.cpp
```

It will produce a binary file (e.g., demo.o) which contains ada.cpp.

It remains to link with libicuuc and libicui18n under Linux and macOS. This is specific to your system. It may be as simple as doing:

```
c++ -std=c++17 -o demo demo.cpp -licuuc -licui18n
./demo
```

You may build and link using CMake (--target demo), because CMake can configure all the necessary flags.
